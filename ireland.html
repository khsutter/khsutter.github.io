                <h3>Enniscorthy Castle</h3>
                 <p>
                     This is a picture from when we went to Enniscorthy and visited Enniscorthy Castle. It took a two and a half hour train ride from Dublin for us to get there. This castle is now a museum which contains a timeline of who inhabited it. One of the families who owned it in the early 1900s was my great-grandfather’s family. It was really interesting to see the history and know my family once lived here. They bought the castle to restore it and did a great job of doing so. The castle was built in 1190 so the history is very rich and quite long. It was one of the highlights of our trip!

                <h3>Cliffs of Moher</h3>
                <p>On a two day tour of West Ireland, we went to visit the Cliffs of Moher. It was a beautiful sight and looked like something out of a movie. It borders on the Galway Bay and is best to see at sunset. While we were there we got to see Obrien’s Tower that's almost 200 years old tower and worked well as an observation site. At the South Platform, it’s a good spot to see seabirds which benefit greatly from the Cliffs of Moher being a Special Protection Area for birds. Though this is a picture of me and my family, it’s easy to tell how breathtaking and beautiful the view is!

                <h3>The Giant's Causeway</h3>
                <p>Though you can’t see how interesting these rocks are, the basalt columns at The Giant’s Causeway are peculiar for their tree stump-like shape and their abundance. Ireland is great for sights in nature, especially on the water. Similar to the Cliffs of Moher, the areas by the water are unique. These columns formed over 60 million years ago, which makes them much more ancient than the castle. The visitors center was a great spot with its small museum and tour guides. Do be warned, going here takes a bit of hiking, but at the high points, the view makes it extremely worth it.
