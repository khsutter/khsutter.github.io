                <h3>Griffith Observatory</h3>
                 <p>
                    For the first part of the trip, we went to Los Angeles and Hollywood! In this picture, me and my brother are looking over Los Angeles from the Griffith Observatory. There was a planetarium inside  but this was harder to get to as shows would fill up quickly. You were able to see the Hollywood sign from where I was standing. I’d recommend visiting during a tour due to difficulty parking, though if you do that it might make your chances of seeing a show at the planetarium even worse. We went on a tour during this trip and it was super fun so I strongly suggest it!

                <h3>Disneyland</h3>
                <p>
                    After we went to Los Angeles, we went to Disneyland. This part of the trip was awesome because I had never been to Disneyland before. In this picture we’re in the Star Wars area with the Millennium Falcon. The ride hiding under the Millennium Falcon is called the <i> Smuggler’s Run</i> where you can control the ship and go on a mission to smuggle loot. I'd recommened waiting for admission to the Rise of the Resistance ride. This wasn’t the only spot we went to in the park, the other sections I enjoyed were Tomorrowland, Adventureland, and Fantasyland.

                <h3>Redondo Beach</h3>
                <p>
                    For the last part of our trip, we went to Redondo Beach. It was supposed to be the “beach” part of our trip where we’d swim and suntan (we went in June) but it ended up being too rainy and cold. Redondo Beach was an adorable little city, but I think my favorite part was their ice cream. The best spot was Handel’s Homemade Ice Cream. For food I'd recommend going to the Rockefeller. Though it was pretty dreary on our beach trip, me and my family still made the most out of it by playing frisbee on the beach and exploring the town.
