            Hi! I’m Kate Sutter and this is my first time designing a website, so I thought it’d be fun to make a blog about past trips that I’ve been on. I have a love of traveling and writing so I’m hoping that those two come into perfect harmony for this website. To begin with a little bit about me, I’m a junior at UW-Madison and recently declared in a digital studies minor so I welcome you to see the start of my journey with everything technological! I’m currently majoring in environmental studies and english (specifically creative writing), I have a passion for saving the environment and writing poetry and hope to do that more in the future. The places I will be blogging about on this website are:</p>
            <ul> 
        <li>Belize and Guatemala</li>
        <li>Ireland</li>
        <li>California</li>
        </ul>
             <p> Thank you for visiting my website and I hope you enjoy! </p>
