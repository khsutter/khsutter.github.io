                <h3>Ziplining</h3>
                 <p>
                     For the first part of the trip, me and my family went to the <a href="https://nohochchencavesbrancharchaeologicalreserve.bravesites.com/nohoch-che-en-zipline">Nohoch Che’eh Cave’s Branch Archeological Reserve</a>. For the first part of our trip there, we went ziplining for an hour on five different lines. These lines were as high as <strong>190ft</strong> above the forest floor and we got up to speeds of about <strong>30mph</strong>. There was even one line that went over the Cave's Branch River. The instructors who came along with us were super nice and offered to take videos of us on each of the lines. Now we have a photo album of our fun on the ziplining course. It took about an hour to complete. I highly recommend doing this as it was so much fun for us!

                <h3>Cave Tubing</h3>
                <p>After we went on the ziplines, we took about a thirty minute walk down to the cave tubing location. Though there were plenty of other groups going as well, that didn’t taint our experience. We went through the cave in a row of tubes and even got out at one point to jump off a <strong>20ft</strong> tall rock into the water. Not only that, but the cave tubing instructor took us on a journey throughout the cave where we got to go into smaller spots and dive through secret holes. (<i>I wouldn’t recommend this is you’re claustrophobic!</i>) The tour took 3 hours including the walking back and forth. It was relaxing to be on the water, it was like a lazy river!</p>

                <h3>Mayan Ruins</h3>
                <p> The next day, we went on a trip to Guatemala from our resort in Belize in order to see the Mayan ruins in Tikal. Seeing these ruins was a highlight of the trip because seeing historical sites on vacation is one of my favorite things to do. The ruins were inhabited from the sixth century BC to the tenth century AD, which means these ruins are ancient! We got to explore these temples and even spotted some howling monkeys while we were there. Our resort helped us get to the Guatemalan border and from there we met a tour guide that took us on a two hour drive to make it to Tikal. The view there and on the way back was beautiful.</p>
